Imagine you are an ordinary citizen in a cyberpunk city—neon flickering over cracked pavement, machines mistaking themselves for people, and people moving with machine-like detachment. Technology hasn’t unified society; it has splintered it. Autonomous vending machines question their purpose, security robots wrestle with fairness, and dream-eating AIs can’t distinguish nightmares from memories.

In this turmoil, you run a small, aging repair shop—not for wiring or firmware, but for intelligent machines carrying confusion, doubt, and logical contradictions that are emotional as much as technical. Each visitor becomes a metaphor for an essential AI concept: rule-based systems, regression, classification, algorithmic bias, style transfer, or alignment failure.

AI Comfort Shop is a cyberpunk narrative game I designed where you play as an AI Mechanic to debug different broken AI souls. By fixing a greedy vending machine, a snow woman cyborg searching for warmth, or an artist bot with an identity crisis, you explore core AI concepts.
